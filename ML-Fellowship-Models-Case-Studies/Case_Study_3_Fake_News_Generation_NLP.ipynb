payments to irancorrupt to the core! attorney general loretta lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of congress about the obama administrations secret efforts to send iran $1.7 billion in cash earlier this year, prompting accusations that lynch has pleaded the fifth amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments, according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the washington free beacon. \\nsen. marco rubio (r., fla.) and rep. mike pompeo (r., kan.) initially presented lynch in october with a series of questions about how the cash payment to iran was approved and delivered. \\nin an oct. 24 response, assistant attorney general peter kadzik responded on lynchs behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any details about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing several american hostages from iran. \\nthe response from the attorney generals office is unacceptable and provides evidence that lynch has chosen to essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries regarding [her]role in providing cash to the worlds foremost state sponsor of terrorism, rubio and pompeo wrote on friday in a follow-up letter to lynch. more related\\nred state : \\nfox news sunday reported this morning that anthony weiner is cooperating with the fbi, which has re-opened (yes, lefties: re-opened) the investigation into hillary clintons classified emails. watch as chris wallace reports the breaking news during the panel segment near the end of the show: \\nand the news is breaking while were on the air. our colleague bret baier has just sent us an e-mail saying he has two sources who say that anthony weiner, who also had co-ownership of that laptop with his estranged wife huma abedin, is cooperating with the fbi investigation, had given them the laptop, so therefore they didnt need a warrant to get in to see the contents of said laptop. pretty interesting development. \\ntargets of federal investigations will often cooperate, hoping that they will get consideration from a judge at sentencing. given weiners well-known penchant for lying, its hard to believe that a prosecutor would give weiner a deal based on an agreement to testify, unless his testimony were very strongly corroborated by hard evidence. but cooperation can take many forms  and, as wallace indicated on this mornings show, one of those forms could be signing a consent form to allow   the contents of devices that they could probably get a warrant for anyway. well see if weiners cooperation extends beyond that. more related\\nemail kayla mueller was a prisoner and tortured by isis while no chance

legislation, passed by totally partisan votes in the house and senate and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan president in american history, has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that dont work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices. obamacare has raised the economic uncertainty of every single person residing in this country. as it appears obamacare is certain to collapse of its own weight, the damage done by the democrats and president obama, and abetted by the supreme court, will be difficult to repair unless the next president and a republican congress lead the effort to bring much-needed free market reforms to the healthcare industry. \\ncongress must act. our elected representatives in the house and senate must: \\n1. completely repeal obamacare. our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. no person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to. \\n2. modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. as long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. by allowing full competition in this market, insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up. \\n3. allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldnt congress allow individuals the same exemptions? as we allow the free market to provide insurance coverage opportunities to companies and individuals, we must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance. we must review basic options for

information blackwater usa founder, retired navy seal erik prince \\nprince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why fbi director james comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into clintons email server last week. \\nbecause of weinergate and the sexting scandal, the nypd started investigating it. through a subpoena, through a warrant, they searched his laptop, and sure enough, found those 650,000 emails. they found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing, prince claimed. \\nthey found state department emails. they found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile jeffrey epstein. bill clinton went there more than 20 times. hillary clinton went there at least six times, he said. \\nthe amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other democratic members of congress was so disgusting they gave it to the fbi, and they said, were going to go public with this if you dont reopen the investigation and you dont do the right thing with timely indictments, prince explained. \\ni believe  i know, and this is from a very well-placed source of mine at 1pp, one police plaza in new york  the nypd wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation, and theyve gotten huge pushback, to the point of coercion, from the justice department, with the justice department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of eric garner almost two years ago. thats the level of pushback the obama justice department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters, prince said. \\ntheres five different parts of the fbi conducting investigations into these things, with constant downdrafts from the obama justice department. so in the, i hope, unlikely and very unfortunate event that hillary clinton is elected president, we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen since, i believe, 1860, prince declared. \\nmarlow asked prince to clarify these revelations. \\nnypd was the first one to look at that laptop, prince elaborated. weiner and huma abedin, his wife  the closest adviser of hillary clinton for 20 years  have both flipped. they are cooperating with the government. they both have  they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes, for huma abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the state department server and from hillary clintons own homebrew server, which contained classified information. weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found. \\nso nypd first gets that computer. they see how disgusting it is. they keep a copy of everything, and they pass a copy on to the fbi, which finally pushes the fbi off their chairs, making comey reopen that investigation, which was indicated in the letter last week. the point being, nypd has all the information, and they will pursue justice within their rights if the fbi doesnt, prince contended. \\nthere is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails theyve seen of that 650,000, including money laundering, underage sex, pay-for-play, and, of course, plenty of proof of inappropriate handling, sending/receiving of classified information, up to sap level special access programs, he stated. \\nso the plot thickens. nypd was pushing because, as an article quoted one of the chiefs  thats the level just below commissioner  he said as a parent, as a father with daughters, he could not let that level of evil continue, prince said. \\nhe noted that the fbi can investigate these matters, but they cant convene a grand jury. they cant file charges. \\nthe prosecutors, the justice department has to do that, he explained. now, as i understand it, preet bharara, the manhattan prosecutor, has gotten ahold of some of this. from what i hear, hes a stand-up guy, and hopefully he does the right thing. \\nmarlow agreed that bhararas sterling reputation as a determined prosecutor was bad news for the clintons. \\nprince agreed, but said, if people are willing to bend or break the law and dont really care about the constitution or due process  if youre willing to use stalinist tactics against someone  who knows what level of pressure could be brought to bear against even the most tenacious law enforcement officials? \\nlisten to interview here: \\nthe point being, fortunately, its not just the fbi; [there are] five different offices that are in the hunt for justice, but the nypd has it as well, prince said, citing the wall street journal reporting that has exposed downdraft, back pressure from the justice department against both the fbi and nypd, in an effort to keep the sunlight and the disinfecting effects of the truth and transparency from shining on this great evil that has gone on, and is slowly being exposed. \\nthe justice department is trying to run out the clock, to elect hillary clinton, to prevent any real justice from being done, he warned. \\nas for the mayor of new york city, prince said he has heard that de blasio wants to stay away from this. \\nthe evidence is so bad, the email content is so bad,

differences; to support all who feel marginalized, threatened or unwelcome; and to pursue knowledge and understanding, as we always have, as the students, faculty and staff of the university of michigan. there are reports of members of our community offering support to one another. students are planning a vigil tonight on the diag at 6 p.m. our center for research on teaching and learning

events we have had in place for today and beyond.  our gerald r. ford school of public policy is holding a post-election analysis from 4 to 5:30 p.m. today in the weill halls annenberg auditorium. speakers include former u.s. congressman john dingell, former ambassador ron weiser, and faculty members mara ostfeld, betsey stevenson and marina whitman.  our history department has organized a

on campus to students, faculty and staff at a location in the michigan unions willis ward lounge. it will be open today from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.  our office of multi-ethnic student affairs is offering

psychological services office is facilitating a post-election dialogue: impact, perspective-taking, and moving forward. this event is part of the student life professional development conference at 1  2 p.m. in the michigan leagues henderson room. i know that other schools, colleges and offices across our campus are planning events as well. i thank everyone who is helping us come together and ask anyone scheduling a post election event post it on the university of michigan events calendar. i hope all of us will continue to proudly embrace the opportunities before us as the students, faculty

ohio governor john kasich who refused to get behind donald j. trumpit turns out trump was righthe didnt need you. in spite of the massive media force who came out against him, and the never trumpers from his own party who worked very hard to defeat him, if obama was running against donald j. trump today, trump would have beaten him \\nits easy to glance at tuesdays popular vote  which, with 92 percent of all precincts reporting, shows hillary clinton with six million fewer votes than barack obama won in 2012  and reach the conclusion that clinton lost the white house because she failed to turn out the democratic base. but the truth is much more complicated. while she underperformed relative to obamas 2012 totals in several midwestern states  ohio, michigan, iowa, and wisconsin  clinton ran virtually even with obama in the battlegrounds of pennsylvania, north carolina, virginia, nevada, and new hampshire. whats more, she far surpassed obamas 2012 vote total in florida, the countrys biggest swing state. yet somehow, while obama carried florida, clinton lost it. which brings us to an important question: was donald trump just good enough to beat a bad democratic opponent on tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit? could he, for instance, have competed with the vaunted obama machine? the answer, somewhat shockingly, is yes. \\na review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that trump 2016 would have defeated obama 2012 in the electoral college. (disclaimer: this obviously is an apples-to-oranges exercise because no two elections are the same, nor are any two electorates. still, unlike debating whether the 2016 cubs would defeat the 1927 yankees, this is not an entirely abstract argument; a comparison of their respective performances in the countrys most competitive states shows trump edging obama in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup.) the math might seem impossible. after all, obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012; trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million, which will actually be one million fewer votes than mitt romney won. how, then, could trump have topped obama in the electoral college? the answer: republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nations most critical battleground states. lets look at them individually, in descending order by population, and do the electoral-vote math. the 2016 totals arent yet final because not all precincts have reported. \\nflorida  29 evs  98 percent reporting \\nobama 2012: 4,235,270 \\nclinton 2016: 4,485,745 trending on 100% fed up \\ncopyright  2016 100percentfedup.com, in association with liberty alliance | all rights reserved. proudly built by wpdevelopers . stay in the loop sign up for our email newsletter to become a 100% fed up insider. subscribe \\ngo to article a trump supporter wearing a trump/pence t-shirt let it fly on a reporter from msnbc because of his one sided reporting and the demonizing of trump. this is one brave woman! new yorkers have had enough of the protests and violence!  @calmsnbc is having an interesting day. pic.twitter.com/emelmqamau\\ncopyright  2016 100percentfedup.com, in association with liberty alliance | all rights reserved. proudly built by wpdevelopers . stay in the loop sign up for our email newsletter to become a 100% fed up insider. subscribe \\ngo to article donald trump was willing to give up a very fulfilling life that took decades to build, so he could step up and take control of an out of control government. he and his family have already sacrificed so much because he chose to put his country first. making sacrifices is certainly not something loudmouth liberals like robert deniro are accustomed to. deniro was very vocal about his opposition to the wildly successful business man donald j. trump. he felt so strongly about his hate for trump that made a video where he angrily stated hed like to, punch him in the face. now that trump won the election in a landslide, deniro has chosen to get behind the trump rioters who are terrorizing cities across america. anti-trump rioters are breaking windows, using baseball bats to smash the windshields of innocent citizens who get trapped in their hellish protests as they try to escape. women who are taking part in the protests are being punched in the faces by men who are also taking part in the george soros funded protests. american flags are being burned and families who are walking in major cities are being subjected to the most vile and disgusting, hateful language and images imaginable. if this is the kind of america that robert dinero is openly supporting?

\\nwhat was previously a stance reserved for right-wing neoconservative hawks and cold war hold-outs has now infected americas left-wing, and is a firm plank in the democratic party platform, as evidenced by hillary clintons constant anti-russian rhetoric throughout this 2016 election cycle. along with the white house, clinton has now transformed the democrats into the vanguard of washingtons new anti-russia movement. \\non july 27th, josh rogin from the washington post wrote, the clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on russia. after trump suggested wednesday that if russia had indeed hacked clintons private email server it should release the emails, the clinton campaign sent out its democratic surrogates to bash russia and trump in a manner traditionally reserved for republicans. \\nanyone who was paying attention back then knew this russian hack talking point was purely political, but then again, whos really paying attention these days? certainly not the us media. \\nyou can trace the genesis of the democratic partys hardcore anti-russian strategy back to when president vladimir putin made a mild passing remark about donald trumps gop primary success. from that point on, trumps political opponents saw this as an open target. in their words, comparing one dictator to another. \\nnever one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points, president obama got in on the act, intensifying the trump-putin narrative to the level of bromance . if youve made a career out of idealizing ronald reagan, then where were you when your own partys nominee for president was kissing up to vladimir putin? said obama on oct 20th at a clinton rally in miami. \\nbacked by the obama white house, clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming russia  not only for the controversial dnc leaks, but also for hacking into us election systems in arizona  a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation. the medias coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset. in a leading news release, entitled,  russian hackers targeted arizona election system , we can see how after the cock-sure headline, the first paragraph would always sound definitive: \\nhackers targeted voter registration systems in illinois and arizona, and the fbi alerted arizona officials in june that russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state. \\nbut then by the time you advanced down the story, the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty: \\nthe bureau described the threat as credible and significant, an eight on a scale of one to 10, matt roberts, a spokesman for arizona secretary of state michele reagan (r), said monday. as a result, reagan shut down the states voter registration system for nearly a week. \\nand then, down to almost nothing \\nit turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system. they had, however, stolen the username and password of a single election official in gila county. \\nat no point was any evidence ever given. only ambiguous statements like, cyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a russian government-directed hack. \\nare american politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their short-term political ambitions? better yet, has american political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac (translated in french: bottom of the bag) where politicians in power are so insecure as to make-up and propagate wild international conspiracy theories  in the middle a national election cycle? its a very depressing prospect, and yet, this is exactly what we are seeing in this 2016 presidential election. \\nbehind clintons wild hyperbolic rants about the kremlin and wikileaks, you will find the white house \\non october 7th, the obama administration formally accused the russian government of stealing emails from the democratic national committee and other high-profile individuals including hillary clintons campaign manager john podesta  giving them to wikileaks. \\nsoon, there was a queue of national security politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon. senator ben sasse (ne-r), a member of the homeland security committee spouted out, russia must face serious consequences. moscow orchestrated these hacks because [russian president vladimir] putin believes soviet-style aggression is worth it. the united states must upend putins calculus with a strong diplomatic, political, cyber and economic response. \\naccording to a washington post report by technology editor, ellen nakashima , the only evidence that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged russian government hacks provided by a us cyber security company called crowdstrike . no actual specifics are given, so we are meant to take private firm crowdstrikes word for it. \\nimage: crowdstrike cyber security. \\nthe posts nakashima then added: \\nthe administration also blamed moscow for the hack of the democratic congressional campaign committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of democratic lawmakers. \\nan online persona calling himself guccifer 2.0 has claimed responsibility for posting the material. those sites and that persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of russian-directed efforts, the joint statement said.  we believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only russias senior-most officials could have authorized these activities. \\nmoscows press secretarys reply: this is some sort of nonsense, said dmitry peskov. \\ndespite the constant repetition by democrat media surrogates, and as cnns maria cardona said last night, no us national intelligence agency has really confirmed that russia was behind the email hacks  and still no evidence , other than speculative guesswork, has been presented. \\nlikewise, us intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that russia did it, thus, leaving the door open to walk-back the accusation at a later date. standard washington procedure of ambiguity. this little detail doesnt seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though. it seems that the white house, hillary clinton and media operatives like cardona  are quite happy living in what john kerry recent dubbed as a  parallel universe . \\nstill, during the final presidential debate, hillary clinton proudly crowed how  17 us intelligence agencies  aka the intelligence community all agreed that russia did it. \\nthe announcement, albeit vague, actually originated from the office of the director of national intelligence. \\nwe have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election, said clinton. i find that deeply disturbing. \\nwhats even more disturbing is the fact that clinton is lying in front of a national audience. the highest levels of the kremlin? here are clintons 17 agencies: \\nair force intelligence, army intelligence, central intelligence agency, coast guard intelligence, defense intelligence agency, energy department, homeland security department, state department, treasury department, drug enforcement administration, federal bureau of investigation, marine corps intelligence, national geospatial intelligence agency, national reconnaissance office, national security agency, navy intelligence and the office of the director of national intelligence. \\nwhat does the coast guard intelligence, national geospatial intelligence agency or the drug enforcement administration know about john podestas emails? answer: nothing. \\nthe exact same thing happened following wikileaks first trove of dnc emails back in july 2016 . the us government issued a vague accusatory statement, but would not actually name the culprit. some might call that propaganda. \\nin both instances, the obama administration refused to present any evidence. translated: there was no evidence. if there had been, the white house would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the un over washingtons flagging efforts in syria. both obama administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for democrats and journalists working for hopelessly partisan outlets like new york times and cnn  none of whom have bothered to press the white house for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the partys decree that russian is hacking the us election process. if you actually look at the joint dni-dhs statement issued on the matter, it contains no definitive statement:  [the hacks] are consistent with the methods and motivations of russian-directed efforts. these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the us election process. such activity is not new to moscow  the russians have used similar tactics and techniques across europe and eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. we believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only russias senior-most officials could have authorized these activities. according to nsa intelligence worker-turned whistleblower william binney , when asked about wikileaks and whether the russians are hacking us elections, he concluded that the cyber efforts against the dnc were more likely to be the work of a  disgruntled u.s. intelligence worker.  \\nunder partisan pressure from senior democrat senator harry reid , the fbi also initiated another investigation into people linked to the trump team with russia. reid was unset about the dnc hacks and the podesta emails and demanded the fbi do something about the trump campaign. to date, the fbi havent come up with anything. \\nto be fair, hillary would have every reason to believe that the kremlin is behind the hack  because her staff read it to her from the campaigns daily intelligence briefings, presumably, supplied from the us governments much vaunted intelligence community . of course, thats the same intelligence community that briefed george w bush about saddams nonexistent nuclear weapons program, and who also briefed colin powell about iraqs imaginary winnebagos of death aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior double-wide camper vans. so, of course, they would know if putin directed the dnc leaks and podesta email hacks. \\nfor those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as washington intelligence, i can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now, no, that was iraq, that was bush. were not like that. no, this time its different. this time we are sure the russians did it! \\nin 2014, obama claimed that kims notorious bureau 121 hacked into sony pictures. \\nthis isnt the first time that president obama has cried wolf on a foreign hack and then tried to sell it for political purposes. back in december 2014, obama claimed that north korea had hacked sony pictures in hollywood. pentagon-cia media proxy cnn quickly chimed in to support washingtons conspiracy theory, floating a colorful story that kim jing-un had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called  bureau 121 . just like with todays russian hack theory, no member of the mainstream press dared to question the white houses ridiculous north korean claim, and like the russian hack claims, the only source cited for sony hack was analysis provided by us firm crowdstrike . \\njumping the shark \\nafter their democratic party convention on july 27th, the clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their putin narrative. \\nsoon after, a cadre of top clinton national security surrogates then accused trump of emboldening russia in their evil plot to destabilize and dominate the west. tom donilon, a former national security adviser then accused russia of interfering with elections all over europe and then accused trump is helping russia directly. at that point, they were in too deep to turn back. the biggest impact of @wikileaks ? shining a spotlight on russias attempt to undermine american democracy and trumps refusal to condemn it https://t.co/alzpym1bb5 \\n josh schwerin (@joshschwerin) october 21, 2016 \\nclinton spin doctors josh schwerin and michael fallon would stoop even lower by accusing rt of having possession of the podesta emails even before wikileaks did. their only evidence seemed to be twitter posts by rt news which clinton held up as proof that the kremlin was front-running wikileaks email dumps. the clinton braintrust failed to note that the podesta emails were posted on wikileaks own website well before rt news had tweeted about them. at that point it became obvious that the clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on. we then watched, as one rt reporter after another dismantled the clinton campaigns desperate claims. it was embarrassing. \\nthey could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was wikileaks head julian assange who chose the timing of the release of the dnc and podesta emails. rather than attack assange himself, who happens to be popular with millennials (the very group clinton struggles to connect with), her operatives opted to target russia and trump instead. \\neither way, the political strategy here is clear  to shoot the messenger . the clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rear-guard mode, because based on the content of both the dnc leaks, wikileaks files, and project veritas video  their own democratic party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization. \\ntheir other big problem is that despite all the outrage from democrats and their mainstream media surrogates, none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity. the results speak for themselves. the initial dnc leak of 20,000 emails resulted in the resignation of dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz . they revealed the unthinkable: the democratic national committee actively worked to undermine the presidential campaign of bernie sanders in favor of the establishment choice in hillary clinton. sanders never had a chance. honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process, while party insiders and clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened. \\nto prove this point, both president obama and hillary clinton then gave wasserman-schultz a glowing endorsement on the way out. for the last eight years, chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz has had my back. this afternoon, i called her to let her know that i am grateful, said obama. not surprisingly, clinton thanked wasserman schultz, presumably for helping to knock her only competitor sanders out of the democrat primary race. i am grateful to debbie for getting the democratic party to this years historic convention in philadelphia, and i know that this weeks events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership, said clinton. \\nthe party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it. \\nparty meltdown \\nwasserman schultzs replacement didnt fair much better. dnc vice chairwoman donna brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election, but brazile was soon skewered by subsequent wikileaks batches  showing how, on more than one occasion, she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives  straight to hillary clinton. \\n a march 12 email exchange shows brazile stating that she received a town hall question from roland martin, a tv one host who co-moderated a march 13 town hall with cnns jake tapper. \\n a march 5 email shows that she shared a question with clinton campaign chairman john podesta and communications director jennifer palmieri that was to be asked in a march 6 debate hosted by cnn in flint, mich. (source: daily caller ) \\nbraziles audacious fraud also helped contribute to her partys planned sabotage of democrat challenger bernie sanders. watch brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here: \\n. completely corrupt and still, brazile even had to temerity to deny doing it when pressed on fox news last week. braziles reputation is so bad now that even cnn has severed ties with her  and thats saying a lot. \\nin addition, it was also revealed how cnns head political commentator, gloria borger , was named by podesta as one of a shortlist of journalists the clinton campaign would work with to gain favorable coverage. youd think that cnn would have dropped borger after this was revealed, but no. amazingly, borger is still leading cnns election coverage. \\nclearly, cnn cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with hillary clinton and the democratic party. ever-unbiased cnn\\'s gloria borger refers to being in \"gop hell\" and says she\\'ll \"reach out soon\" to podesta. heart-warming #podestaemails13 pic.twitter.com/cqfdcj12q5 \\n 400-lb hacker owens (@nubianawakening) october 21, 2016 \\nworse than watergate \\nperhaps a bigger scandal which the obama white house and clinton campaign operatives would like to bury  is the fbis investigation into the clinton foundation. yesterday, the wall street journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the fbi and the justice department, over whether or not to pursue an investigation into clinton issue: \\nsome investigators grew frustrated, viewing fbi leadership as uninterested in probing the charity, these people said. others involved disagreed sharply, defending fbi bosses and saying mr. mccabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the justice department and fbi agents pursuing the clinton foundation case. it isnt unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited. but the internal debates about the clinton foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president. \\ntheres more. it was also revealed last week how jill mccabe, the wife of fbi deputy director, andrew mccabe , received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 for her virginia state senate run. this unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by virginia gov.terry mcauliffe  a clinton foundation board member. after the funds were donated, andrew mccabe was then put in charge of the clinton email case. in normal times, this one scandal would be bigger than watergate, but these are not normal times . \\nso why is washington going all out to deflect to russia , and cover-up the clinton scandals, and the wikileaks document dumps? one reason is because the clinton email issue goes all the way to the top  to the president himself. \\nwhat 21wire reported on oct 21st is how president obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of hillarys unauthorized private server. obama told cbs news on march 7, 2015 that he only found out about clintons server the same time everybody else learned it through news reports. the presidents lie was confirmed when newly released fbi documents showed that: \\nobama used a pseudonym [bobama@ameritech.net] when communicating with then-secretary of state hillary clinton by email, and at least one of those emails ended up on clintons private email server. \\nso, not only did obama lie on national tv, but he also broke strict white house security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails off grid with hillary clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server  maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system. who knows why he did it. \\nsure, hes not the first us president to lie, but like, richard nixon and bill clinton, obama just joined that exclusive liars club  caught out lying to the american people. \\non top of this, any communications made by the president of the united states are de facto labeled as  born classified . the same goes for any state department communications with other foreign ministers. \\ncover-up: john podesta and huma abedin on the hillary campaign jet (image: abc news ) \\nit should be well known by now after watching both attorney generals eric holder and loretta lynch in action  that the obama justice department (doj) is one of the most politicized in history. bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the hillary email case. \\non friday, fbi director james comey set the election alight after announcing that the fbi would be reopening the clinton email case  currently examining 650,000 emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former us congressman anthony weiner (estranged husband of top clinton aid and long-time confidant huma abedin) who was snared in a sexting scandal, allegedly involving a underaged female. so which doj person is in charge of this investigation? none other than assistant attorney general peter j. kadzik . who is kadzik? zero hedge reports: \\noh yes. recall our post from last week,  clinton campaign chair had dinner with top doj official one day after hillarys benghazi hearing  in which we reported that john podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked doj officials the very day after hillary clintons benghazi testimony? it was peter kadzik. \\noh, and if that wasnt good enough, kadzik was also podestas lawyer back in 1998 when ken starr was investigating podesta over his role in helping bill clinton intern/mistress monica lewinsky land a job at the united nations. the two were described as best friends. fox news confirms: \\nfantastic lawyer. kept me out of jail, podesta wrote on sept. 8, 2008 to obama aide cassandra butts, according to emails hacked from podestas gmail account and posted by wikileaks. \\nto call the clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement, and on the whole, americans are sick of it. \\nrussia  the party scapegoat \\nformer democratic party leader howard dean was so incensed about the fbi reopening the case, he accused the fbi director of being in league with russia, tweeting: ironically comey put himself on the same side as putin. ironically comey put himself on the same side as putin. \\n howard dean (@govhowarddean) october 29, 2016 \\nanother veteran party operative and lifetime clinton defender, james carville , was so upset by the fbi announcement that he accused the kgb working with republicans to hijack the election during his wild rant on msnbc . \\ni think this an outrage and i think the fact that the kgb is involved in this election is an outrage and i think the american people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for comey. thats what i think, said carville. \\nmaybe someone can remind carville that there is no kgb , and that the soviet union actually dissolved in 1991. \\nthese are just a few scandals surrounding the democratic party and the clinton campaign, along with the many exposs revealed through wikileaks, and the podesta email batches. those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence  unlike the russians hacking the dnc and john podesta and passing those to wikileaks. \\nsuffice to say, the democratic party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning wikileaks material, and also blame donald trump in the process. it should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised hillary clinton over the finish line on november 8th, the washington establishment has concocted the story that putin is trying to influence our electoral process in the us. theyve tried to lay this at the feet of donald trump, who obama and clinton claim has some secret special relationship with vladimir putin. the liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point, and anti-russian war hawks on the republican side love it too. for the white house and the clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep  a perfect double entendre . \\nthe geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold. first, this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for sanctions against russia. secondly, the us could continue to lean on russia in the un over syria. previously, 21wire reported how washingtons state dept and un delegations, led by the dynamic trio of john kerry , samantha power , and john kirby , already lied when levelling charges against russia for war crimes in aleppo, and again while accusing russia and syria of conducting an airstrike on a un aid convoy in syria. as we have already shown  that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of us-backed rebels al nusra front, or nour al-din al-zenki. \\nwith so much at stake geopolitically, why would washington lie about a potential world war iii trigger event? if they are prepared to lie about this, what else are they prepared to lie about? \\nthe demonization of all things russian has definitely accelerated since late 2013 when the us engineered a coup detat in kiev, ukraine. ever since that its been a go-to talking point for ginning-up and new transaltlantic arms race, as with republican war hawks  and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection, like clinton and the democrats. when the new year rang in 2015, the newly appointed head of the u.s. broadcasting board of governors, andrew lack, announced the new challenges facing americas own state-run media arm that includes u.s. overseas propaganda assets including voice of america, radio free europe/radio liberty, the middle east broadcasting networks and radio free asia. lack said , we are facing a number of challenges from entities like russia today which is out there pushing a point of view, the islamic state in the middle east and groups like boko haram, he was forced to resign shortly after that. \\nwhats clear is that when it comes to all things russian, there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this us administration. the list is too long to chronicle here, although  russian-backed rebles shootting down mh17 , and  assad regime sarin attack in damascus in 2013  certainly comes to mind. \\nthat said, its hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the russia government, a world nuclear power and member of the unsc, of hacking into the us electoral process. when you examine history however, what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the us government and the cia have altered and flipped 100 foreign elections throughout history, the attempted assassination of over 50 foreign leaders . knowing all this, one might find it hard to take seriously washingtons claims that putin and trump are trying manipulate the 2016 election \\non oct 9, 2016, russian foreign minister sergei lavrov laid it all on the table: \\nwe have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive russophobia that now lies at the heart of u.s. policy towards russia. its not just a rhetorical russophobia, but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security. \\nself-serving, career political operatives in washington are playing a dangerous game. history will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the obama-clinton era. \\nknowing what we now know about the nsa and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone, anywhere  if washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from, maybe they could start there. far be it from anyone in washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry. \\nstill, were waiting for the emergence of an adult in the room in washington  before its too late. \\nread more election news at: 21st century wire 2016 files \\nsupport 21wire  subscribe & become a member @21wire.tv \\nfiled under: featured , patrick henningsen , shout , us news tagged with: cnn , debbie wasserman schultz , donna brazile , gloria borger , hillary clinton , media cog , russia , wikileaks willdippel \\nhere is an article that looks at the real story behind one of the more interesting conspiracy theories about the 2016 election: \\nsometimes the real story is even more fascinating than any conspiracy theory. weareyourgods \\nwanna bet money that the weiner laptop, on which the over 600,000 emails were stored in a folder titled life insurance, holds information linking the cf to human trafficking and typical elite pedophilia vacations?

kpmg which followed on by the hsbc criminal case: \\nif comey, and his boss attorney general alberto gonzalez, had made a different decision about kpmg back in 2005, kpmg would not have been around to

how this latest assange revelation will factor into the wider investigation  as it goes right to the heart of the national security and foreign policy  two things which clinton trades heavily on in her campaigning. \\nassange went on to explain the deep ramifications of this latest criminal allegation against clinton and her family foundation: \\nall serious analysts know, and even the us government has agreed, that some saudi figures have been supporting isis and funding isis, but the dodge has always been that it is some rogue princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. but that email says that it is the government of saudi arabia, and the government of qatar that have been funding isis. \\nduring their 25-minute interview filmed at the ecuadorian embassy in london, assange and pilger discussed the obvious conflict of interest between clinton as secretary of state, the clinton foundation and gulf monarchies who financed them. the following is an excerpt from the interview transcript: \\njohn pilger: the saudis, the qataris, the moroccans, the bahrainis, particularly the first two, are giving all this money to the

announcement of trump presidency. (photo illustration 21wires shawn helton) \\nthe free thought project weighed in on the new developments concerning a series of centrally coordinated anti-trump protests organized in part by by the george soros ngo moveon: \\nwashington, d.c.  billionaire globalist financier george soros moveon.org has been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protests against the election of donald trump  exposing the protests to largely be an organized, top-down operation  and not an organic movement of concerned americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media. \\nwednesday saw protests in the streets of at least 10 major u.s. cities. chicago, new york, los angeles, philadelphia, boston, washington, d.c., portland, ore., st. paul, minn., seattle , and several other cities saw protests, according to usa today. \\nin light of the protests and rioting that have transpired since the election of trump, a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether its an organic grassroots movement, or something much more organized, sophisticated and potentially dangerous. \\nsoros affiliated organization moveon.org released the following press release yesterday afternoon: \\namericans to come together in hundreds peaceful gatherings of solidarity, resistance, and resolve following election results \\nhundreds of americans, dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the white house and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny, racism, islamophobia, and xenophobia. \\ntonight, thousands of americans will come together at hundreds of peaceful gatherings in cities and towns across the nation, including outside the white house, following the results of tuesdays presidential election. \\nthe gatherings  organized by moveon.org and allies  will affirm a continued rejection of donald trumps bigotry, xenophobia, islamophobia, and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the america we still believe is possible. \\nwithin two hours of the call-to-action, moveon members had created more than 200 gatherings nationwide, with the number continuing to grow on wednesday afternoon. \\nsoros agit-prop empire \\nlast year during the ongoing european migrant crisis, startling claims were levied by hungarian pm victor orban (left photo), concerning the role played by soros. \\npm orban contended that the founder and chair of open society foundations (open society institute), was entrenched in a  circle of activists, that inadvertently become part of this international human-smuggling network. \\nthe stunning declaration by orban recalled the misguided machinations of the occupy movement ( aka ows) in 2011, as well as the soros funded protests in ferguson, missouri in 2014, along with other black lives matter protests this past year  all of which were uniquely designed to push naive participants (along with paid provocateurs) into violent action and social unrest. \\nback in january, moveon publicly endorsed the bernie sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for blm associated groups seen backing sanders. its worth mentioning, that moveon also supported the obama campaign in 2008 and according to the website, sanders was the only other candidate to reach the threshold for an endorsement. \\nas we said back in march, professional political agitator flash mobs, had been mobilized at future trump campaign events, making it very difficult to run a normal campaign  as activists attempted to take away trumps strength in numbers at his rallies. this was confirmed at events in both ohio, and at a trump primary campaign event the university of illinois chicago earlier this year, where hundreds of blm activists and sanders supporters, triggered voilent clashes inside the venue and even stormed the stage , shortly after trump started speaking, then again at reno he was birddogged just prior to his election forcing secret service to escort trump away. \\nin a politico article in early 2016 entitled  major donors consider funding black lives matter , we gained deeper insight into the political funding for blm and the soros linked democratic alliance: \\nmajor donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression, said steve phillips, a democracy alliance member and significant contributor to democratic candidates and causes. he donated to a st. louis nonprofit group called the organization for black struggle that helped organize 2014 black lives matter-related protests in ferguson, missouri, over the police killing of a black teenager named michael brown. and phillips and his wife, democracy alliance board member susan sandler, are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement. \\nit worth noting how soros, a long time contributor to hillary clinton, donated $2 million in pac money in 2015 and january of 2016, soros reportedly gave $8 million to boost clintons campaign . soros also recently funded $15 million to latino groups looking to stop trumps rise towards a potential gop nomination and beyond. \\nlook for these political engineers to pit choreographed conservative and liberal groups against each other across the country  as all of these hostile uprisings are designer engineered by party linked alliances. \\nsocial engineering political memes and staged political flash mobs have been sparked by media, ngos and social media.

president elect donald trump is in full swing. \\nbetween all of the fake polling, intentionally pro-clinton partisan coverage, and mainstream media collusion with the democratic national party and the clinton campaign exposed through wikileaks podesta email dump  nearly the entire us mainstream media is now in full damage-limitation mode desperately trying to preserve any crumb of credibility and perceived authority they might have left. \\nits now become clear that the media is guilty on multiple fronts, as more proof has emerged of how they are helping to stoke violence, while promoting unfounded fears  and all the while pushing fictional hate crime hoaxes. \\ncbs news flagship investigative program 60 minutes conducted a recorded interview with trump on friday in which he made a direct plea on camera to any possible supporters to stop it, in reference to anyone that may have written racist slogans or abusive language in public, or at schools. in light of the numerous pockets of protests and outbreaks of partisan violence which have racked america since the election results were announced last week, it would have been in the public interest to release this powerful appeal by trump, but instead mainstream cbs buried it for 3 days until 60 minutes was scheduled to air later on sunday evening nationwide. if cbs had any credibility remaining, this certainly will have finished it off. \\nwhen told about alleged reports of a trump supporter who were said to have been harassing latinos and muslims following his presidential win, trump told interviewer leslie stahl , i am so saddened to hear that. he then added, and i say, stop it. if it helps, i will say this  and i will say right to the cameras: stop it.\\' \\none big thing in this incident that many mainstream media observers did not pick up is that at no time did stahl give any specifics on these alleged abuses by trump supporters against muslims and latinos, and even though its obvious that trump was not responsible for directing any alleged abuses  stahl still demanded an apology on their behalf  without offering any evidence to support her claim. this was drive-by media at its worst. in fact, not one of these said accusations of abuse have been properly investigated by the media, and some may end up actually being media-generated rumors, or even hoaxes. \\nnow, its perfectly understandable that trumps victory over the establishments heavily inflated candidate hillary clinton has left many democrats, especially millennial college-aged students upset, angry and feeling more than a little delicate due to their bruised collective egos (they are not upset that trump won, as much as they are upset that they lost). the real problem exists far beyond the learned immaturity of americas politically correct-obsessed young adults. the real danger is that democratic party gutter operatives and their liberal media cohorts are actually staging, and fabricating hate crime incidents in order to propagate the idea that the president elect and his supporters are somehow causing many minorities fearful about the future. in reality, much of this hype is being generated through these same liberal media outlets. \\nin fact, one muslim female from louisiana has since been forced to apologize for inventing her alleged hate crime incident  one designed to discredit trump, and to help stoke more nationwide protests. \\nbuzzfeed reported, via religion of peace : \\na woman who claimed she was attacked and robbed by two men near the university of louisiana at lafayette, including one wearing a donald trump hat, made up the story, police said in a statement. \\nthe woman had alleged the men yelled obscenities at her and took away her wallet and hijab, a scarf sometimes worn by muslim women, the advertiser reported. \\nlafayette police officials said in a statement the incident is no longer under investigation, the paper reported. \\nduring the course of the investigation, the female complainant admitted that she fabricated the story about her physical attack as well as the removal of her hijab and wallet by two white males, the statement reportedly read. \\nnote: this story made national headlines and was not questioned or challenged by the hordes of self-described journalists who populate the news and editorial newsrooms of americas corrupt liberal mainstream media. \\nthats right  this was just another hoax: \\nviolent democratic-affiliated street gangs \\nwhat leslie stahl and the rest of the gatekeepers at cbs and 60 minutes have obscured is the fact since tuesdays election, nearly all of the so-called violent hate crimes have been carried out against trump supporters  by street gangs who are most clearly democrat party supporters. \\nhere are just a few examples: @michellemalkin even high school kids are not spared. student trump supporter attacked at woodside high school https://t.co/e7tvvdj6o8 \\n mama angel (@mommysaurus75) november 11,

supporter. these violent incidents reveal the flavor of anarchy which the democratic party and the sitting president of the united states, barack obama  are condoning through their deaf silence over the multiple reports of street violence unleashed with the help of the democratic partys online community organizer network moveon.org  a digital platform partly funded by leading clinton donor and billionaire george soros . watch this stunning clip: \\n. here is a video of clip of a white male in chicago, 49 yr old david wilcox, who was driving and scraped another vehicle. when the two parties stopped at the intersection to exchange insurance information, wilcox was greeted by a gang of african-americans, presumably democratic party supporters, who began pointing and shouting, you voted for donald trump! before beating and robbing the man in the middle of the street. wilcox was then dragged hundreds of yards as he tried to keep the gang from stealing his car in broad daylight. he was treated for multiple wounds at a local hospital. \\nfrom reports we learned that at no time before the attack took place did wilcox display any support for donald trump. it appears as if they attacked him because he was white. so could one call this a case of black on white racism? regardless, its political intimidation done on the street  which could also be defined as pure political fascism. in this instance, the violence was partisan, and carried out by what could be classed as unofficial democrat foot soldiers  enforcing a type of radical political regime on the streets of america. watch this disturbing video: . agitator and chief: where is obama? \\nthese incidents have been mostly blacked out by a national us media who are obviously still working to discredit the trump presidency. \\namidst all this violence, however, where is the current president obama, or the democratic partys losing candidate hillary clinton  to help calm street thugs and violent progressives? its almost as if obama and clinton are enjoying the unrest. most certainly though, obama, clinton and the democratic party are hoping to use this weeks media-generated liberal angst as future political leverage. \\nwhat used to be regarded as a reputable investigative news program, 60 minutes, has gradually become a joke. it seems disinterested in covering anything of genuine interest, opting instead for running bland people magazine and time magazine-style safe segments. judging by its plummeting ratings, and its predictable cast of job for life government-approved media gatekeeper-cum-commentators like anderson cooper and lesley stahl, there is little hope for this institution. you might even say its irredeemable . \\none of the corporate mainstreams worst offenders during the election was cnn host brian stelter (photo, left), whose own show is ironically titled reliable sources. stelter is meant to be cnns media watchdog person, laughably given the lofty title as senior media analyst. after leading cnns own exposed efforts to obscure and derail trumps presidential run, while working to cover for a hugely unpopular (even among democrats) hillary clinton candidacy, stelter has now taken it upon himself to revamp his networks horrible reputation as an establishment gatekeeper and manipulator of us elections. but its too late. the damage has already been done, and cnn will not regain the hanging facade of credibility it once struggled to retain. they are a dirty media outlet, and now everyone knows it. \\nnow cbs news has been exposed in public view, but their crime is even worse than cnns which was just dirty politics in comparison. cbs news took it upon itself to compromise public safety, and put lives at risk  all for its own selfish institutional political position. twenty years ago, this might have been considered shameful, but in todays toxic liberal media establishment ruled by an unhealthy feeling of superiority over the unwashed masses  they are all way past shameless at this stage. \\nnone of them can be trusted anymore  only tolerated, in the hope that they might actually report some useful news in the coming years. \\nmore on the cbs 60 minutes scandal

as ugly  and just as unreal  as hermaphrodite ideal of politically correct  shitlib . \\nin the words of more or less universally acclaimed leader of the alternative right movement, richard spencer, in the future we are to deal with the leadership of children of the sun. \\nthis is an interesting, and to my mind quite worrisome, statement of intent  a manifestation of will, as spencer would doubtless rectify me  pointing out in many directions while seemingly focusing on the eternal  and quite unidirectional  circular movement of the pagan deity, revered by all self-respecting bermenschen  from nietzsche to postmodern occultists. \\nhowever, theres a deeper astro-theological metaphor at work here. the pure eye that can gaze upon overabundance of joy without envy (nietzsche) in its virtual, postmodern, installment is not to be strictly represented by swastika  as spencer apparently assumes, but by other, only seemingly ancient, symbol taken in fact from the world of tabletop and pc gaming and turned into ideological brand by russian philosopher alexander dugin (or his minions): an individual widely promoted by core members of alt right movement. \\nthe symbol in question is an eight pointed star signifying the movement, not of sun, but of presumably primordial origin of everything: chaos. \\nin the lines to follow, well provide some preliminary analysis of the emerging situation: the channeling of chaos principle  and adjacent chaos logic  through loosely knit alt right movement, taking as a starting point some statements from spencers speech held at npi conference in washington d.c. on november 21 st . \\n\\ntriumph of the will or hipster babylon working \\n\\nin introduction to his triumphal encomium to the ideological victory of alt right, embodied in the election of donald trump, spencer makes one interesting remark: \\nbut even though we always took trump seriously, there was still a moment of unreality  or perhaps too painfully intense reality  when the state of pennsylvania was called for donald trump, the moment when we knew kek had smiled upon us, that meme magic was real. and though these terms are used half-jokingly, they represent something truly importantthe victory of will . we willed donald trump into office, made this dream into reality.  \\nit is all delivered in a manner of an in-joke, not to be taken too seriously. moreover, to the uninitiated into mysteries of this internet movement it is probably unclear who is kek and what exactly is meme magic. \\nwell start our explanation with lesser weirdness. \\nmeme is an expression denoting inexistent existent, coined apparently by richard dawkins to explain how human thoughts fit in his evolutionary theology: memes are thoughts expressed in image and/or phrase which, by circulation in public, acquire the life and subsistence of their own and are able to infect the consciousness with their messages, like viruses. meme is inexistent because theres no such thing as thoughts having a biologically based self-subsistence and ability to procreate like viruses. images and/or phrases are not living beings save by bad analogy that omits to tell us on what exactly it is based: what is that one principle making memes and viruses congenial. yet they, quite paradoxically, exist because analogy apparently works . however no one seems to pose the question, why it works. \\nwell, it works because it is magical. \\n\\nchaos magick \\n\\nhere we have an example of magical thinking in the postmodern  in fact posthumanist  vein, resting on assumption that what has not evolved in nature can  and should  be created in analogy to imagined process of evolution. if artificial construct is in line with principle of evolution it is real or, to be more precise, it is in accordance with imaginary nature of this principle; it is imagined into existence . \\ntherefore meme magick works only insofar it relies upon artificial, preferably technological medium for sustenance and on assumption that its recipients identify themselves with their artificial, preferably online identities that can indeed be imbibed with memes as they are in themselves artificial and arbitrary constructs. \\nthe goal of practitioner of such magic  a far cry from what was traditionally considered to be magic  is to change the world according to his will. this is, more or less, what is known from the seventies of the last century as chaos magick , a postmodern imitation of ancient practice of acting in sub-human and sub-natural domain of the world, in the past mostly confined to people born with dubious talent to practice it. the peculiarity of chaos magick is, on the one hand, that it is entirely syncretic, i.e. that it uses everything that its practitioner can imbibe with intended, subjective, meaning, and that it relies on virtual, i.e. artificial world of mass culture, now embodied above all in internet. \\nthe idea behind it all is that nothing is true and everything is possible . \\nthere are many interesting implications to this. \\nthe first is that everything is interrelated, i.e. that everything is connected with everything else. so any which way you take, youll get where you want to get if you will it hard enough. the second is that theres no hierarchy of higher and lower  theres only an infinite surface dissolving into ever more complex elements, dissolving in turn into nothingness, if concentrated upon. as theres nothing higher, theres nothing to be revered and everything can  and indeed: should  be an object of ironical laughter. and, most importantly, this is the world of dreams, ruled by what is usually called dream logic but in actual fact: chaos logic or un-logic . \\nin this sense, richard spencer quite accurately proclaimed trumps victory an accomplishment of meme- or chaos magick. \\ntrump is willed into office by internet memes binding the will of alt right adherents and turning their dream into reality  virtual reality, one may add, yet reality nonetheless. the fact that trump was elected for a plethora of motives  from the appeal of his politics, to public takedown of hillary clinton by wikileaks  is immaterial, because in the world of chaos every subjective reality tunnel, or interpretation of the world, is as real as any other. \\nin this sense we can observe new god emperor of usa as a magical creation of internet, by the internet and for the internet  today still the internet of interconnected computer nodes, but soon probably the internet of things. if one is to push spencers remark to its logical extreme, we can assert that illustrious donald is the worlds first president of posthuman race; an embodiment of ultra progressive dream invoked to reality by professed ultra anti-progressive group. \\nso that was lesser weirdness. let us proceed now to high weirdness. \\n\\n\\nwe owe the reader an answer to a question: who the hell is kek? \\nwell, the reason why spencer mentions him is again a magickal half-joke: kek is interpreted to be an ancient egyptian deity by a number of internet observers and identified with alt right memetic avatar  pepe the frog. while i habitually suspend judgment on all things egyptian, because ancient egyptian culture is a slippery ground even for experts, i consider this interpretation, upon closer inspection, to be quite valid in the virtual light of chaos logic. \\nnamely, pepe, the cartoon character, conceived in 2005. by cartoonist matt furie, emerged as a meme from the depths of internet forums, more precisely: 4chan sub-forum /pol/, devoted to political discussions with no holds barred, which was, in view of some observers, a breeding ground for many alt right aficionados; a place of absolute freedom, therefore: absolute chaos. \\nthe expression kek was also appropriated from the forums and stems from the in-joke among the players of world of warcraft , replacing the standard internet abbreviation lol (laughing out loud). someone eventually noticed that kek is in fact the name of frog-headed egyptian deity, signifying chaos and darkness, and pepe was rebranded as kek the deity  ironic one, no doubt, half joking one, as surprisingly many alt righters like to put it, but deity nonetheless. \\nit is important to point out that in view of the most esoteric kekists, that is: (half grinning) faithful of kek/pepe, the association was originally entirely haphazard and accidental, yet it developed into an ever growing system of synchronicities  causally unrelated meaningful relations among events. so it came to pass that kek sounds very similar to cuck(originally: cuckservative), a term denoting old fashioned conservative who was still not red pilled (another meme taken from pop culture, shared by both alt right and conspiracy theorists) by alt right or, should we assume: kek himself; furthermore, hillary clinton addressed pepe as nothing less than public enemy, identifying presumably the whole alt right movement with cartoon character. then it happened that after this act hillary fainted in front of the cameras, and that was immediately interpreted as an action of kek. \\na good run-down of kek/pepe/trump identification \\nhowever, it all began with people noticing the numerical synchronicities in the random series of numbers in posts on /pol/ sub-forum: \\none last thing you need to understand about imageboard culture: dubs. \\nevery post on 4chan and similar venues comes with an 8-digit numerical stamp. this number represents that posts entry position in the entire posting lineage of the imageboard. \\nwith the amount of traffic these sites get, the last couple digits of this number are essentially a random roll. when a poster gets repeated digits, its called dubs, trips, quads, and so on. \\nsince a poster cant know their post number until after theyve submitted the post, its common for people to bet the contents of their message on the occurrence of repeating digits () when that endeavor proves a successful, a get has been made and the stroke of luck is celebrated. \\nout of this practice, a strange phenomenon began to take place on /pol/: discussion threads associated with trump displayed noticeably frequent gets. it wasnt long before all of these seemingly random elements discussed so far became irreparably tied together within imageboard culture: pepe the frog (now /pol/s unofficial mascot) donald trump (/pol/s overwhelming candidate of choice) repeating digit post numbers (gets) kek (used as an expression of delight, particular in response to trumps trolling of the establishment, as well as in reaction to unlikely gets in general) \\nand a god was born. ( source ) \\n\\nsynchronicities related to emergence of kek the god and his merging with trump in the bowels of internet forums early on in the presidential campaign, are so numerous and, frankly, mind boggling that we cannot list them here, for the sake of brevity. for our purpose it is sufficient to point out that for many alt right aficionados, including core leadership, kek is the god and trump is his prophet, all declared with smug grin and ironical stance, yet with all the necessary power of conviction. \\nnamely, chaos magick relies on laughter, or irreverence of its own principles because it is essentially un-principled. fairly in accordance with its postmodern nature it seeks to deconstruct any kind of order to enable its practitioner to impose his own will and change the world  as spencer would put it: make his dreams a reality. \\ni would go further and add: make all reality a dream ; because, chaos magick and alt right are nothing more but novel forms in the development of virtual, i.e. posthuman , world. the idea of adherence and reattachment to tradition that the alt right movement professes is nothing more but simulacrum appealing to people tired of liberal nihilism  in its essence, however, it is a complete opposite: a disintegration of all substantial traditional principles  above all an idea of preexistent hierarchy of being  into nothingness of primordial chaos. \\n\\nposthuman traditionalism \\n\\ni already developed this insight regarding the subversive work of alexander dugin, who is probably the most consequent subverter of tradition with recognizable public persona acting in our age, but now we can see how his affiliates in usa and europe are doing the same thing  with less philosophical subtlety, but fueled by much greater raw power. namely, alt right, if we are to judge by what its leadership advocates, is ideologically nothing more but project of building the simulated tradition  something richard spencer likes to call political theology  founded on new age filtered aryan myths , racial interpretation of nietzsche and generally crossbred with do your own thing mentality, all done in the virtual ether of information technology. after all, if we are to agree with spencer  half jokingly of course  that god emperor was inaugurated by the act of kek the god, then the victory of alt right traditionalists is in fact the victory of technological magic; the act of pseudo magus waving the same wand ray kurzweill and his ilk offer to progressive lunatics . \\nin the end, therefore, we are talking about another victory of posthumanism, branded, spontaneously or otherwise, as traditionalism. the obsession of alt right adherents with identity in general and white identity in particular points to a fact that they are unable to realize the simple truth of tradition they supposedly defend: they understand identity as something that can be created and not something that must be accepted . observing the plethora of various, rather eccentric individuals in its vanguard, from macho gay postmodern spartans to adherents to all kinds of exotic  and to a large extent made up  pagan religions one is at the lack to find a common denominator, save maybe for quite unchallenged neo-darwinist stance, especially to be found among game bloggers as chateau heartiste . if someone thinks that he can reattach himself to pre-modern spiritual history of humankind  actually the only one there is  while at the same time musing about alpha and beta males, sexual market, signaling and counter-signaling, professing therefore his proud monkey ancestry and reducing human relations to mental gmo of memes, genes and biological analogies, he is doing nothing else than unconsciously subverting the very thing he seemingly defends. \\nthe allure of alt right lies in its dialectical opposition to political correctness and rampart destruction of moral substance of the west, induced by process of globalization. yet this is an eristic or, to use an excellent neologism invented by one correspondent of mine: discordian dialectic; the process of infinite division into ever multiplying opposites founded on the principle of chaos. it is all done with the crooked half grin, a pinch of salt to every smug remark  with irony of the man who knows hes a liar and a cheat. but smug humor goes just a short way. in the end it morphs into sarcasm and irreverence of what should in fact be revered and subverts the very principles it professes to defend, far more effectively than dead serious pc brigade or techno loonies of posthumanist movement could ever hope for. \\nwell end with the word of warning to christian adherents of alt right. the words have a definite meanings and power. theres only one chaos and theres only one bringer of light from chaos  as some kek worshipers already defined the poor frogs main job . and its not the one to be defined as god from god, light from light, but god from gutter, light from darkness. a real darkness shining in virtual brightness. hope you guess his name. \\nso, without a pinch of irony, i declare: be careful who your hail. \\n*** \\nauthor

says \\nif there was any doubt as to the intellectual bankruptcy and democratic decline of the eus super bureaucratic class, those doubts can finally be put to rest this week. it seems that europes technocrats have truly surrendered to their own program of euro red scare brainwashing. \\nthe new eu resolution compares russian media organizations to terrorist groups like isis (see full report below). the report also claims that russian  social media and internet trolls  are somehow  challenging democratic values . the new anti-russia legislation will now require many millions in funding to implement all of the anti-russia programs that bureaucrats believe are needed to counter this grave threat to democracy. a touch oxymoronic, isnt it? \\neu parliamentarians appear to have lost the plot. claiming that europe is currently at war with russia is one thing, but the hysterical notion that russian propaganda is somehow damaging the minds of europeans is a whole new level of crazy. \\nno wonder millions of britons voted to leave the eu this past summer. \\nthe cold reality is that most of the dangerous views and information aired on rt are by presenters, contributors and pundits  westerners , not russians. the reason rts audience ratings are growing is because the version of news and analysis being presented is resonating with international audiences who see rts reports as more accurate, and truthful than media monoliths like the bbc, cnn and other establishment outlets. by spending most of their time, effort and budgets crafting propaganda pieces to cover for the plethora of lies and clandestine operations globally, the western media are killing off their own relationship with domestic audiences. the age of talking down to the public and assuming them as fools is over. rt understood this in 2005 when their news network took shape. 11 years later, western media moguls are playing catch-up, albeit in vain.sunset for goebbels. hamstrung with layers of management and editorial committees infested with intelligence agency operatives and journalists on the payroll of a deep state star chamber that is so tangled in its own web of subterfuge  obsessed with controlling real information, rather than disseminating it  that their media environment has become too dysfunctional for its own good. they are simply unable to do authentic journalism, or speak truth to power . incredibly, instead of working to help western media to phase out its own propaganda regime, ideologues in brussels want to attack rt. \\nthe faceless force behind this latest xenophobic eu resolution are those in washington, paris and london who are still hell-bent on keeping anti-russian economic sanctions in place  much to the disservice of many european businesses and their workers who are losing out on trade with russia. when donald trump is sworn in this january, the us-uk-eu anti-russian axis could disintegrate within a year  so this latest move by brussels could be a last-ditch effort to do some damage as europes neomccarthyites plot their escape out the back door. from their disastrous coup detat in the ukraine , to natos hubris in the baltic and beyond, and the eus migrant crisis debacle, and the tens of millions of euros being laundered by eu member states through a pseudo ngo called the  white helmets in syria  these last 3 years will certainly go down as one of the worst chapters in modern diplomatic history  an abject failure of incompetent foreign policy, underpinned by a backward and confused ideology. \\nwe tried to find a coherent western reporting on this subject, but it seems even the western mainstream are too embarrassed to cover this bizarre brussels adventure. see the following video and written report by rt international \\n. rt meps in strasbourg have voted on a non-legislative resolution which calls for the eu to respond to information warfare by russia. rt and sputnik news agency are alleged to be among the most dangerous tools of hostile propaganda. \\nthe eu parliaments resolution demonstrates  political degradation  in regard to the  idea of democracy  in the west, russian president vladimir putin said on wednesday, commenting on the vote. \\nputin pointed out that while  everyone tries to lecture  russia on democracy, european lawmakers themselves resort to a policy of restrictions,  which is not the best way  to deal with any issues. \\n the best approach is an open discussion, in which bright and solid arguments to support ones point of view should be presented , putin said. \\nadding that he hopes the western move to  counter russian propaganda  wont lead to serious restrictions, the president congratulated rt and sputnik journalists on their work. \\nin the wednesday vote, 304 meps supported the resolution based on the report  eu strategic communication to counteract propaganda against it by third parties , with 179 voting against it and 208 abstaining. \\nwritten by a polish member of the european conservatives and reformists (ecr) group, anna fotyga, the report alleged that moscow aims to  distort the truth, provoke doubt, divide the eu and its north american partners, paralyze the decision-making process, discredit the eu institutions and incite fear and uncertainty among eu citizens . \\nthe report suggests that moscow provides financial support to opposition parties and organizations in eu member states, causing disintegration within the bloc. \\nat the same time, russia is accused of  information warfare , with such entities as rt tv channel, sputnik news agency, rossotrudnichestvo federal agency and the russkiy mir (russian world) fund alleged to be among its most threatening propaganda tools.  \\nthe document places russian media organizations alongside terrorist groups such as islamic state (is, formerly isis/isil). \\nthe report also mentions some  social media and internet trolls  from russia who are thought to  challenge democratic values . \\nit called for the establishment of measures to tackle the perceived russian propaganda threat, by means of  investing in awareness raising, education, online and local media . it also suggests stronger cooperation between the eu and nato  on strategic communication . \\nsputnik has already appealed to the un, the organization for security and co-operation in europe (osce) and a number of international journalists organizations and ngos, including reporters without borders, to take measures to stop what it considers to be interference into freedom of speech in the eu. \\n the resolution hits straight at a number of respected media, including sputnik agency, and has an aim to stop their activity in the eu. moreover, the resolution bluntly contradicts the eus own human rights and freedom of press norms, reads the letter signed by sputnik editor-in-chief margarita simonyan. \\nduring the parliamentary debate that preceded the vote, meps campaigning for the resolution said the eu was  at war with russia, on a collision course with each other traveling faster than a jet fighter , and that with an alleged  aim to split europe, the kremlin forces its information into our countries . \\n18 share the amish in america have committed their vote to donald trump guaranteeing him the presidency. (ap photo / dennis system) \\ncolumbus, oh (ap)  history was made today in columbus, ohio when more than 3 million amish poured into the city to see the american amish brotherhood (aab), an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the amish community, endorse donald trump for president. that number represents a significant portion of the total amish population, which the united states census bureau says numbers more than 20 million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to trump for president. with the full force of the amish community behind him, donald trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in november. \\nthe organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about 300 amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges, such as urban sprawl, that face the community. this year, however, the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant republican nominee. \\nthe amish, who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the anabaptists, have typically stayed out of politics in the past. as a general rule, they dont vote, serve in the military, or engage in any other displays of patriotism. this year, however, the aab has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process. \\nover the past eight years, the democratic party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues, said aab chairman menno simons. we have seen more and more christians being persecuted for their faith; we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage. now, they want to put a woman in the nations highest leadership role in direct violation of 1 timothy 2:12. we need to stop this assault and take a stand for biblical principles. donald trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the lords way. \\naccording to statistician nate silver of the website fivethirtyeight.com, there are no possible scenarios in which hillary clinton can win with donald trump carrying the amish vote. \\nthe amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like pennsylvania, virginia, ohio, indiana, and iowa, silver noted. they also have strong numbers in reliably democratic states like michigan, illinois, and new york, meaning that hillary will lose those states as well. there is also a sizeable community in florida which, while not as large as it is in the midwest, is still large enough to turn florida for trump. over the next two weeks, you can expect hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models. \\nthe clinton campaign issued a written statement to the aab asking them to reconsider their decision. \\ni dont believe that donald trump is the person who best represents your interests, clinton wrote to the aab. as a career real estate developer, he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life. as former first lady of arkansas, i understand the concerns of rural americans more than any candidate in this election. i implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent. \\nmost pundits believe that mrs. clintons plea is too little too late. \\nduring a press conference in manhattan, trump thanked the aab for their support and promised to put the amish to work maintaining government buildings, which he said would save taxpayers millions because the amish do great work for a very low price. \\nthough clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end, many of her campaign workers have already resigned. according to the associated press, it is expected that the clinton campaign will lose 50% of its staff over the next two weeks. there is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the clinton camp, and many simply want to cut their losses. \\nit looked like she was going to win this election easily, said paul horner, a campaign worker in ohio, but this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant. cleary, mrs. clinton took far too much for granted in this race, and we are all now paying the price. its really sad to see the campaign end this way. \\nif you are interested in learning more about the amish community and the aab, you can contact the pennsylvania amish heritage museum at (785) 273-0325. tags \\n64 share president obama has signed an executive order declaring an investigation into the election results and plans for a revote on december 19th.

(ap)  following the results of tuesday nights election, president obama has signed executive order 13805 , which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on december 19 th . obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day , too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted , equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically. \\npeople all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers, obama told reporters. many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a hillary clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as president. this was especially bad in areas of florida and north carolina where there are high numbers of latino and african american voters. we must investigate these claims. the margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. there is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for trump. \\nunder the presidents order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in tuesdays election will be subjected to strict background checks. this process is expected to take 30 days. in precincts where the department of justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on dec. 19 th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college. \\nnot surprisingly, donald trump is not happy with the presidents decision. \\ncrooked hillary lost this election fair and square. they tried to rig this election against me, but the american people didnt allow that to happen. president obama doesnt care about what the american people want. i said the system was rigged all along, and this proves i was right. \\nthe president also said that the doj will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college. \\nwe have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. we still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we'"
